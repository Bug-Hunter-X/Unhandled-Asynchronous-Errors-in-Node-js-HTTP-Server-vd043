# Unhandled Asynchronous Errors in Node.js HTTP Server

This repository demonstrates a common error in Node.js asynchronous programming: improper handling of errors in asynchronous operations within an HTTP server.

The `bug.js` file shows an example of an HTTP server that performs an asynchronous operation.  If the operation fails, the error is logged to the console, but the response to the client is incomplete, and no error status code is provided. This can lead to unexpected behavior for the client.

The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version with improved error handling.  It sends a proper error response to the client with an appropriate status code if an error occurs during the asynchronous operation.

## How to run

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the repository directory in your terminal.
3. Run `node bug.js` to see the buggy version. 
4. Run `node bugSolution.js` to see the corrected version.

## Key improvements in the solution:

* **Proper error handling:** Catches errors during asynchronous operations and sends a proper HTTP error response (e.g., 500 Internal Server Error) to the client.
* **Informative error responses:** Sends a response body containing details about the error (but avoid sensitive information in production).
* **Clear logging:** Logs errors to the console for debugging purposes.

This example highlights the importance of robust error handling in Node.js applications, particularly when dealing with asynchronous operations.
